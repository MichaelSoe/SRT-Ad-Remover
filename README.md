# SRT SUBTITLE AD REMOVER

**Version: 1.0.0**

_Created by MichaÃ«l Soetaert_

## Description

This small python script allows you to remove ads from subtitles. This script will go over each line 
in an SRT file and will check against a list of predefined ad identifiers. If a line contains any 
of those ad identifiers, the full subtitle block (meaning all the data needed to display the subtitle, 
including the timestamps) will be removed from the file. 

If an ad isn't being recognized by the script, you can simply add the identifier to the list 
of predefined ad identifiers and it will be deleted when you run the script.
